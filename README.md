# CrewAyush 🎙️🤖

CrewAyush is an **AI-powered debate platform** with two dedicated roles:

* **Debater** — crafts persuasive arguments for or against a given motion.
* **Judge** — evaluates debates based solely on **argument quality, clarity, and fairness**.

This project aims to make debates **objective, educational, and engaging** by removing human bias from judgment.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Input a Motion** — e.g., *"Artificial Intelligence will replace most jobs in the next decade."*
2. **Debater Role** responds **for** and/or **against** the motion.
3. **Judge Role** assesses both sides and declares a winner.
4. The evaluation is based entirely on logical quality, not opinion.
